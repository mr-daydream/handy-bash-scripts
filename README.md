# handy-bash-scripts
Sometimes I make scripts to do things for me. If I like them, I put them here.

## howyoudoin.sh
Given a parameter of SCM type (currently only git or svn) this script recursively runs the status command and outputs only if there are changes staged. Otherwise there's only ONE WORD to describe it and this script will spell...it...out for you.

Usage:
`howyoudoin.sh <git|svn>`
